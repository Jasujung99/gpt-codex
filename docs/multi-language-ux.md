# Multi-Language User Experience

This document describes the proposed user interface for the **CodeTranslator** service.

## Side-by-Side Panels

Learners will see two code panels displayed next to each other. One panel shows the source code and the other displays the translated version in the chosen language. Editing either side updates the translation so students can immediately compare syntax and structure.

## Interactive Translator Tool

A toolbar lets learners pick source and target languages (for example, Python, JavaScript or Scratch). When code is entered or pasted into the source panel, the tool translates it on the fly. Students can experiment with code snippets to understand differences across languages.

## Guided Examples

Lessons and quizzes may present short code fragments with side-by-side translations. These examples help reinforce concepts by highlighting common constructs in each language.
